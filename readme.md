# How to run



# To Do
## Features
* Do we present same order for lines or do we sort based on time to arrival?
* How do we handle errors?  Do we continue to show the last available data?  
* Can we make a pretty way to print a table?

## Code Health
* Need to get some better error handling in here
* Split up the functions a bit this thing is ugly as sin
* Do we need unused vars?  E.g stop point ref and destination display?
